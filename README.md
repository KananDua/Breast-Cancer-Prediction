📌 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning & Risk Analysis Project by Kanan Dua

📖 Overview

This project demonstrates the analysis of clinical data to identify high-risk cases, using machine learning to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign. It showcases an end-to-end workflow for data-driven risk assessment, including preprocessing, exploratory analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

Key aspects:

Data preprocessing & validation

Exploratory data analysis

Model training & testing

Risk prediction & reporting

⚠️ Note: The dataset is not included due to its age, but you can run the notebook using datasets like the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from scikit-learn.

🧠 Approach & Methodology

The workflow demonstrates typical data analysis and risk modeling:

Importing and preprocessing clinical data

Splitting into training and test datasets

Testing multiple ML algorithms

Selecting the best-performing model

Evaluating predictions using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

This emphasizes the ability to analyze data, assess risk, and support decision-making.
